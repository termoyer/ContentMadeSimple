-> What is it?

ContentMadeSimple wants to help you, create and organize your Website.
It's a Content Management System, what means, it allows you to simply create/delete/modify Pages/Images/Settings and much more!
The Core of this CMS bases on LotusCMS, which is not updated anymore, but ContentMadeSimple is!

-> What do I need?

Okay, that's the interesting thing: ContentMadeSimple is a flat-file based CMS, what means, that you will not need any database!
The only things you need:
  - A Webspace that supports PHP (Generation 4 or later)
  - A FTP-Client, which allows you to upload Files/Folders onto your Webspace and set rights
  - A Webbrowser and about 2 minutes of time t setup your ContentMadeSimple-Website

-> Something else, important to know?

Yeah, there is one thing, what may be a problem: The Core (find in in "core" folder of your copy) of ContentMadeSimple needs to be updated from time to time. 
Normally the CMS should autmaticly inform you about an available update, but we can't be sure yet! What it means for you? This: You should be sure, that you have installed the latest version.
For this reason, we've build in a newsmodule right onto the lower right of the Admin's Dashboard. It allows us to tell you news everytime something happens. In this case, when a new version is released.
Please be sure to check this News-Section evertime you login to the Admin. Thanks!
