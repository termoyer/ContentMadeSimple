ContentMadeSimple wants to help you, create and organize your Website.
It's a Content Management System, what means, it allows you to simply create/delete/modify Pages/Images/Settings and much more!
The Core of this CMS bases on LotusCMS, which is not updated anymore, but ContentMadeSimple is!

-> What do I need?

Okay, that's the interesting thing: ContentMadeSimple is a flat-file based CMS, what means, that you will not need any database!
The only things you need:
  - A Webspace that supports PHP (Generation 4 or later)
  - A FTP-Client, which allows you to upload Files/Folders onto your Webspace and set rights
  - A Webbrowser and about 2 minutes of time t setup your ContentMadeSimple-Website

-> Known Issues!
This issues are known and do not need to be reportet:
  - Dashboard: There is a red and a green message, when CMS is up to date.
  - Dashboard: The update reminder may not work 100% correctly. Please have a look at the news section at the right bottom of the dashboard to notice a new update!
  - Modules: Site "find more plugins" can not be shown.
  - Update Plugin-function do not work correctly. Allways shows an available update but there isn't!
